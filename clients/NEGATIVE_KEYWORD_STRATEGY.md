# Negative Keyword Consolidation Strategy
## Ocean Movers Main + T&E Moving & Storage LLC

### Executive Summary

**Current State:**
- **Ocean Movers**: 1,457 unique negatives (2,064 campaign + 20 ad group + 2 shared lists)
- **T&E Moving**: 2,920 unique negatives (37 campaign + 613 ad group + 9 shared lists)
- **Overlap**: Only 233 keywords shared (16% of Ocean, 8% of T&E)
- **Total Unique**: 4,144 keywords across both accounts

**Problem:** Massive divergence = inconsistent protection, duplicate management effort

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Core Shared Lists (Week 1)

1. **Create in Google Ads:**
   - Moving_Co_Rental_DIY (240 kw) ‚≠ê PRIORITY
   - Moving_Co_Jobs_Employment (26 kw)
   - Moving_Co_DIY_HowTo (15 kw)
   - Moving_Co_Junk_Items (41 kw)
   - Moving_Co_Real_Estate (119 kw)

2. **Apply to both accounts**
   - Ocean Movers Main (CID: 1556744976)
   - T&E Moving (CID: 5840144764)

### Phase 2: Test & Monitor (Week 2-3)

1. **Track metrics:**
   - Impression share lost to negatives (should increase 5-10%)
   - Conversion rate (should stay stable or improve)
   - Wasted spend (should decrease or stay at $0)

2. **Review search queries:**
   - Check for any good queries being blocked
   - Adjust if needed

### Phase 3: Expand (Week 4+)

1. **Add situational lists:**
   - Moving_Co_Marine_Ocean (for Ocean Movers definitely)
   - Moving_Co_Geographic_Exclusions (based on service areas)

2. **Selective additions from "Other":**
   - Review the 3,631 "Other" negatives
   - Add most relevant to shared lists
   - Keep hyper-specific at account level

### Phase 4: Audit & Maintain (Monthly)

1. **Monthly search query review:**
   - Find new unwanted patterns
   - Add to appropriate shared list
   - Remove any over-blocking negatives

2. **Quarterly sync:**
   - Review divergence between accounts
   - Update shared lists
   - Remove redundant account-level negatives

## Match Type Strategy

### PHRASE Match (Recommended for 80%)
- Blocks the term + close variations
- Examples: "truck rental", "hiring", "how to"
- **Best for:** Generic unwanted terms

### EXACT Match (Use for 15%)
- Blocks only exact query
- Examples: "10 ft uhaul truck", "boat movers jacksonville"
- **Best for:** Specific competitor names, hyper-specific queries

### BROAD Match (Use sparingly - 5%)
- Blocks term + broad variations (can be too aggressive)
- Examples: "dealer", "junk"
- **Best for:** Words that are NEVER relevant
- **Risk:** Can block good queries with that word

---

## ROI Analysis

### Time Savings
- **Current:** ~2 hours/month per account managing negatives = 4 hours/month
- **After:** ~1 hour/month managing shared lists = 1 hour/month
- **Savings:** 3 hours/month = 36 hours/year

### Performance Impact
- **Current:** $0 wasted on truck rental (both accounts already good)
- **After:** Potentially $0 wasted + better impression quality
- **Improvement:** 5-10% better impression quality (less irrelevant searches)

### Scalability
- **Current:** Each new client needs new negative keyword research
- **After:** Apply proven shared lists to new clients immediately
- **Benefit:** 80% negative coverage on day 1 for new accounts
