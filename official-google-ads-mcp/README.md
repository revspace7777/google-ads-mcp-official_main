## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to configure and run the Google Ads MCP Server.

### 1. Configure Python Environment

#### For Direct Use

This project needs Python 3.12 with `pipx` or `uv`.

#### For Development

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management.

Install `uv` and then run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
uv pip sync
```

### 2. Configure Google Ads credentials

This tool requires you to have a `google-ads.yaml` file with your Google Ads API credentials. By default, the application will look for this file in your home directory.

If you don't have one, you can generate it by running the following example from the `google-ads-python` library:
[authentication example](https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-python/blob/main/examples/authentication/generate_user_credentials.py)

Make sure your `google-ads.yaml` file contains the following keys:

- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `refresh_token`
- `developer_token`
- `login_customer_id` (optional, but recommended)

### 3. Launch MCP Server

#### For Direct Use with Gemini CLI

Update your Gemini configuration to include the `google-ads-mcp` server. The following is an example of a local MCP server configuration:

```json5
{
  // Other configs...
  "mcpServers": {
    "GoogleAds": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--spec",
        "git+https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/google_ads_mcp.git",
        "run-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_YAML"
      },
      "timeout": 30000,
      "trust": false
    }
  }
}
```

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using the Gemini CLI. Type `/mcp` in Gemini to see the `Google Ads API` server listed in the results.

#### For Local Development with Gemini CLI

Update your Gemini configuration to include the `google-ads-mcp` server. `[DIRECTORY]` will be the absolute path to the project. The following is an example of a local MCP server configuration:

```json5
{
  // Other configs...
  "mcpServers": {
    "GoogleAds": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "[DIRECTORY]",
        "-m",
        "ads_mcp.server"
      ],
      "cwd": "[DIRECTORY]",
      "timeout": 30000,
      "trust": false
    }
  }
}
```

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using the Gemini CLI. Type `/mcp` in Gemini to see the `Google Ads API` server listed in the results.

You can then ask questions like:

- "list all campaigns"
- "show me metrics for campaign `[CAMPAIGN_ID]`"
- "get all ad groups"

#### Direct Launch

To start the server directly, in the project path, run the following command:

```bash
uv run -m ads_mcp.server
```

The server will start and be ready to accept requests.
